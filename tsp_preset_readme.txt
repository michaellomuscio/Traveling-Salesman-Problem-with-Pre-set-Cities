# Traveling Salesman Problem with Pre-set Cities

## Overview
This example demonstrates the use of a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a set of pre-defined cities.

## How to Use
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Click "Start Optimization" to see the genetic algorithm optimize the path among the pre-defined cities.

## Mechanism
The genetic algorithm optimizes the path using:
- **Selection**: Routes with shorter distances have a higher chance of being selected.
- **Crossover**: Combines two routes to produce a new route.
- **Mutation**: There's a chance to swap two cities in a route to introduce variability.
